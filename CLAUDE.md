# agentmux

Configurable tmux agent launcher. Shell scripts only — no Python, Node, or other runtime dependencies.

## Stack

Shell scripts only — split between bash, POSIX sh, and (for the fish integration) fish, by what each script needs:

- **bash** (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`) — anything that uses `source`, `local`, `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}`, or arrays. That's `install.sh`, `bin/amux`, `shell/agentmux.sh`, and every config/style consumer (`agentmux-config.sh`, `agent_window_style.sh`, `tab_label.sh`, `cycle_mode.sh`, `launch_agent.sh`, `relaunch.sh`).
- **POSIX sh** (`#!/bin/sh`) — standalone tmux-hook adapters and pure-compute utilities with no source-time dependencies: `summarise.sh`, `summary_rows.sh`, `strip_unbacked_done.sh`, `llm-config.sh`, `tmux-status.sh`, `update_colors.sh`, `window_seen.sh`, `claude/{status,ctx,digest}.sh`.
- **fish** (`shell/agentmux.fish`) — the fish-shell integration only. It is a thin wrapper around `bin/amux` plus a `complete` line; it never sources bash libs (fish can't). All real logic stays in `bin/amux`.

When adding a script, pick the shell by that rule, not by default. `toml2json` + `jq` are the only runtime dependencies. Don't introduce new ones.

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bin/amux` | The `amux` launcher — standalone bash, single source of truth for amux logic |
| `scripts/` | Shared runtime scripts (`tmux-status.sh`, `summarise.sh`, etc.) |
| `scripts/claude/` | Claude Code adapter scripts (`status.sh`, `ctx.sh`, `digest.sh`) |
| `scripts/<agent>/` | Pattern for future agent adapters (e.g. `scripts/gemini/`) |
| `shell/agentmux.sh` | bash/zsh integration: thin `amux` wrapper + zsh completion |
| `shell/agentmux.fish` | fish-shell integration (thin wrapper + completion) |
| `tmux/agentmux.conf` | tmux snippet sourced from `~/.tmux.conf` |
| `config/agents.toml.example` | Example agent config |
| `VERSION` | Semver version string |

## Local dev setup

`~/.agentmux/scripts`, `~/.agentmux/shell`, `~/.agentmux/tmux`, and `~/.agentmux/bin` are directory-level symlinks to the repo. Changes to scripts are live immediately — no install step needed during development.

The Claude Code hook path is `~/.agentmux/scripts/claude/status.sh`. Scripts do **not** need to be copied to `~/.claude/hooks/`.

## Versioning

Bump `VERSION` (semver) when making a meaningful change. `amux --version` reads `~/.agentmux/VERSION` (copied there by `install.sh`). Update `~/.agentmux/VERSION` manually during dev if you need `amux --version` to reflect a working bump.

## Selftests

Several scripts have built-in selftests — run before changing them:

```bash
SUMMARISE_SELFTEST=1         scripts/summarise.sh
STRIP_UNBACKED_DONE_SELFTEST=1 scripts/strip_unbacked_done.sh
SUMMARY_ROWS_SELFTEST=1      scripts/summary_rows.sh
CLAUDE_CTX_SELFTEST=1        scripts/claude/ctx.sh
CLAUDE_DIGEST_SELFTEST=1     scripts/claude/digest.sh
AGENTMUX_CONFIG_SELFTEST=1   bash scripts/agentmux-config.sh
AGENTMUX_STYLE_SELFTEST=1    bash scripts/agent_window_style.sh
AMUX_SELFTEST=1              bash bin/amux
```

`summarise.sh` also has an optional live-LM smoke test that hits the configured endpoint and asserts the prompt rules survive (third-party scope, anti-invention). Manual only — skips silently if the LM is unreachable:

```bash
SUMMARISE_SMOKE=1 scripts/summarise.sh
```

## Linting

`shellcheck` is the linter (install with `brew install shellcheck`). It's lint-only, not a runtime dep, so it doesn't conflict with the toml2json + jq rule — but it's expected to be run before landing shell changes, not treated as optional:

```bash
shellcheck scripts/*.sh scripts/claude/*.sh shell/agentmux.sh bin/amux install.sh
fish -n shell/agentmux.fish   # fish can't be shellcheck'd; this is its syntax check
```

Known-benign findings (do **not** chase these to zero — they're inherent to the patterns, not regressions):

- **SC1091** "Not following: …" — dynamic `source "$SCRIPT_DIR/…"` paths shellcheck can't resolve statically.
- **SC2154** `_llm_url`/`_llm_model`/`_llm_timeout` "referenced but not assigned" — set by `_amux_load_llm` inside `llm-config.sh`; shellcheck doesn't trace function-set globals across a sourced file.

Real findings (anything else, especially error-level) must be fixed or, for a genuine false positive, suppressed with a commented `# shellcheck disable=<code>` on that line (see the zsh `(@f)` line in `shell/agentmux.sh`). A clean run filters to actionable severity:

```bash
shellcheck --severity=warning scripts/*.sh scripts/claude/*.sh shell/agentmux.sh bin/amux install.sh
```
